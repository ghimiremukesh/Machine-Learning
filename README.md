Programming Assignments for Online Machine Learning Class

This repository consists of solutions to the programming assignments in one of the Machine Learning courses I took. The materials presented here should only be used as reference and should not be used in any way that might result in violation of honor code for your class. 

All the codes are written in MATLAB. MATLAB Is usually used for prototyping machine learning applications. 

I have tried to avoid loops as much as possible and vectorized almost every operation in these assignments. Use this as a guideline to how to write a simple one-line code for carrying out calculations which take a lot of indices tracking when done through loops. Using vectors also makes your code significantly efficient.
